# Larger Number App

## *Kieron Oei*

**Larger Number App** (aka "Cal Admission Test") prompts the user to select which of the two numbers presented is larger. The background color is updated depending on if the correct answer is chosen. I followed the tutorial from Rahul Pandey's Android Development class ( CS194A )
